## :octocat: Git and GitHub

**Git helps track changes as you work on projects.** Git tracks the changes you make so you always have a record of what you‚Äôve worked on and you can easily revert back to an older version of your code if need be. It also makes working with others easier‚Äîgroups of people can work together on the same project and merge their changes into one final source! 

**GitHub is a collaborative web platform.** GitHub uses Git to track every contribution and contributor to your project‚Äîso you know exactly where every line of code came from. 

## üíª GitHub features 

### Repositories 

A repository is where your project work happens. It contains all of your project‚Äôs files and revision history. You can work within a repository alone or invite others to collaborate with you on those files. As you work more on GitHub you will have many repositories. Use your GitHub dashboard to easily navigate to them. You must be logged in though! 

Repositories contain README‚Äôs that introduce each project.  When you create a new project, always add a README. :smile:   Read more about repositories [here](https://docs.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/about-repositories) and repository README‚Äôs [here](https://docs.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/about-readmes). 

## :octocat: Understanding the GitHub flow 

There are many ways to edit files using Github.  Direct editing via the repo is the most dangerous (since you are commiting changes without testing them) and should only be one for quick fixes you are sure of. Here are other methods: 
1. **CodeSpaces**: Open Codespaces from the green Code button, Codespaces tab. When a .devcontainer.json file (like the one here) is included, you can run HTML and CSS files without having to install the Live Preview extension, which is quite handy. And there is a commit to repo button - but **always include a commit message** or it breaks. 
1. **Notepad++**: You can download a .zip of your files, extract them (Important!) and then edit them individually with Notepad++ (pin it to your Taskbar). But you have to manually upload them back to the repo at the end of each class, and keep your downloads empty so you do not overwrite files.  This is our "backup" method if Codespaces has problems. 
1. **VSCode++**: This offers the best of both worlds: local files, a rich coding environment, and button-driven connections to GitHub.  However, it requires some fancy configuration up front, so we do not start with this method. 

### Cloning and forking 

You can clone a repository to create a local copy on your computer (or on Codespaces) and then use Git to sync the two. Forking a repo is like cloning, except that it is a connection that allows updating. 
1. **Cloning** a repository pulls down a full copy of all the repository data that GitHub has at that point in time, including all versions of every file and folder for the project.
Read more about cloning here. 
2. **Forking** is another way to copy a repository, but is most commonly used when contributing to someone else‚Äôs project. Forking a repository allows you to freely experiment with changes without affecting the original project and is very popular when contributing to open source software projects.
3. **Assignments**: When you work with GitHub Classroom, you fork a "template repo" to your own copy to edit.  You can simply submit it, or (if it is a collaborative assignment) add a pull request to contribute it to the class. 

Read more about forking [here](https://docs.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/cloning-a-repository).

### Pull requests

Pull requests let you tell others about changes you've pushed to a branch in a repository on GitHub. Once a pull request is opened, you can discuss and review the potential changes with collaborators and add more changes if need be. 

Adding someone as a reviewer on your pull request is a signal to them that you want help or would like them to review the content. 

Read more about pull requests [here](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/about-pull-requests). 

### Branching 

Sometimes we "re-architect" code to make substantial version changes.  You can use branches on GitHub to isolate work that you do not want merged into your final project. Branches allow you to develop features, fix bugs, or safely experiment with new ideas in a contained area of your repository. You always create a branch from an existing branch. Typically, you might create a new branch from the default branch of your repository‚Äî`main`. 

Once your new changes have been reviewed by a teammate, or you are satisfied with them, you can merge your changes into the default branch of your repository.

Read more about branching [here](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/about-branches). 

### Issues

Issues are like social media threads for your code.  They are useful for collaborative work, and also if you are keeping notes about what you are learning. Use issues to track enhancements, tasks, or bugs for your work on GitHub. Issues are a great way to keep track of all the tasks you want to work on for your project and let others know what you plan to work on. For larger projects, you can keep track of many issues on a project board. GitHub Projects help you organize and prioritize your work and you can read more about them [here](https://docs.github.com/en/github/managing-your-work-on-github/about-project-boards). 

Pull requests and issues can also be linked together! You can link a pull request to an issue to show that a fix is in progress and to automatically close the issue when someone merges the pull request. 

Read more about issues and linking them to your pull requests [here](https://docs.github.com/en/github/managing-your-work-on-github/about-issues). 

### Using markdown on GitHub 

You might have noticed already, but you can minimally style your issues, pull requests, and files (as long as they are .md format!). Using Markdown in your issues, pull requests, and files helps organize your information and make it easier for others to read. You can also drop in gifs and images to convey your point!

Read more about using GitHub‚Äôs flavor of markdown [here](https://docs.github.com/en/github/writing-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax). 

### Your user profile

Your profile page tells people the story of your work through the repositories you're interested in, the contributions you've made, and the conversations you've had. You can also give the world a unique view into who you are with your profile README. You can use your profile to let future employers know all about you!

## üìù Optional next steps 

* Create a new markdown file in this repository. Say you learned and what you are still confused about, experimenting with styles.
* Open a pull request and let your teacher know that you‚Äôve added a markdown file to the repo.  
* OPTIONAL: Create a profile README. What are you interested in learning? What are you working on? What's your favorite hobby? [Here](https://docs.github.com/en/github/setting-up-and-managing-your-github-profile/managing-your-profile-readme) are steps on how to do that.
